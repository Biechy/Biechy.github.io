# Machine Learning

Although often confused with Artificial Intelligence (AI) by the general public, **Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of it**. Unlike a traditional AI algorithm, which can relies on hard-coded rules (such as many `if` and `else` conditions), **ML learns from data** to provide more appropriate responses. Historically, this learning was closely related to statistics. However, with the rise of "black box" algorithms, which may deliver better performance, a distinction has emerged between two subfields of ML: **Statistical Learning** (SL) and **Deep Learning** (DL).

In this journey through the mental palace, we will delve deeply into both SL and DL. Before we do, as scientific researchers, **it is crucial to begin with an introductory chapter on statistical modeling** because ML rely on fundamental statistical concepts, and a solid understanding of these foundations is essential to grasp the nuances of modern techniques.
