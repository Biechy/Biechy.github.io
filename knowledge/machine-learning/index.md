Although often confused with Artificial Intelligence (AI) by the general public, Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of it. Unlike a traditional AI algorithm, which relies on hard-coded rules (such as many `if` and `else` conditions), machine learning learns from data to provide more appropriate responses. Historically, this learning was closely related to statistics. However, with the rise of "black box" algorithms, which may deliver better performance, a distinction has emerged between two subfields of machine learning: Statistical Learning (SL) and Deep Learning (DL).

In this journey through the mental palace, we will delve deeply into SL and DL. Before we do, however, as scientific researchers, it is crucial to begin with an introductory chapter on statistical modeling because ML rely on fundamental statistical concepts, and a solid understanding of these foundations is essential to grasp the nuances of modern techniques.
