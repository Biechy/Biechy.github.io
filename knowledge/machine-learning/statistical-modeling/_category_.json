    "description": "Statistical modeling is one of the many branches of mathematics whose aim is to represent phenomena, in this case random ones. This branch is divided into two sub-categories: parametric modeling and non-parametric modeling. Each of these adopts a distinct approach, which leads us, in this journey, to approach each problem in these two forms. In any case, it is essential to know this chapter to better understand machine learning."
