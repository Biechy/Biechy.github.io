Internet : A network of network

Question : How to identifying devices on a network
Answer : the IP address and the MAC address

### **I**nternet **P**rotocol Address

It is a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time with a set of numbers that are divided into four octets. To determine these numbers, you have a protocol : IP.

A network may have devices with only private IP address to comunicate. If so, you can reach Internet with one public IP address with the **I**nternet **S**ervice **P**rovider.

### **M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol Address

The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. It can be faked !
Exemple : a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d mean that Intel created it (a4:c3:f0) and put the unique number (85:ac:2d)

**I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol : protocol to send packet of bytes through networks. The time taken for ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping.
